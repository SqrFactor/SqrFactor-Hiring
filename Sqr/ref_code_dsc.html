            <h4><strong>How does the Referral Code works?</strong></h4><br>

1) Complete the Registration Process (Example - X,Y and Z register as Team Members)<br>
2) Complete the Transaction/Payment Process.<br>
3) After you have completed the Payment, you will receive an email with the Team Registration code and Referral codes for each team member.<br> 
4) Example -<br>Team Member 1(X) will have referral code as Team Registration Code(Example : G16KA13S001)+ 01 = G16KA13S00101 will be the Referral code for Team Member 1.<br>Similarly for Team Member 2(Y) and Team Member 3(Z) will have their referral code as Team Registration Code(Example : G16KA13S001) +02 and +03 respectively.<br><br> 
So the Referral Codes for the Team Members will be :<br>
Team Member 1 = Team Registration code(Example : G16KA13S001) + 01  = G16KA13S00101<br>
Team Member 2 = Team Registration code(Example : G16KA13S001) + 02  = G16KA13S00102<br>
Team Member 3 = Team Registration code(Example : G16KA13S001) + 03  = G16KA13S00103<br><br>

<strong>Note* - For Individual Registration, there will be only 1 referral code. For Team of 2 there will be 2 referral codes and For Team of 3 there will be 3 referral codes.Above given codes are just examples</strong><br><br>

<h4><strong>How does it benefit me?</strong></h4><br>
The Team member gets a referral code which they can refer to their friends to get a recharge coupon worth Rs. 50(Only if their referral code is used by their friends/Team).<br><br>

<h4><strong>How does it benefit new teams/individuals registering for the competition?</strong></h4><br>
